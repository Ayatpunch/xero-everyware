/**
 * @fileoverview Data Flow Documentation between Everyware and Xero Systems
 * 
 * @description
 * This document outlines the data flow between Everyware's payment processing system
 * and Xero's accounting software. The integration handles payment processing and
 * automatic invoice creation/reconciliation.
 * 
 * Flow Overview:
 * 1. Invoice Creation in Everyware
 * 2. Payment Processing
 * 3. Webhook Notification
 * 4. Xero Integration
 * 
 * @module DataFlow
 */

/**
 * @section Invoice Creation Flow
 * @description
 * 1. Client initiates invoice creation via POST /invoices/create
 * 2. System validates required fields:
 *    - LineItems
 *    - BusinessName
 *    - TotalAmountDue
 *    - BillToCellPhone
 *    - Business Address Details
 * 3. Everyware SDK creates invoice and generates payment link
 * 4. System returns invoice details with payment URL
 */

/**
 * @section Payment Processing Flow
 * @description
 * 1. Customer receives SMS with payment link
 * 2. Customer completes payment through Everyware's interface
 * 3. Everyware processes payment and generates transaction record
 * 4. Everyware sends webhook notification to our system
 */

/**
 * @section Webhook Processing Flow
 * @description
 * 1. System receives webhook at POST /webhooks/payment
 * 2. Validates payment status (StatusID === "0" for success)
 * 3. Extracts payment details:
 *    - PaymentSid (Unique identifier)
 *    - PaymentAmt (Amount paid)
 *    - PaymentDate
 *    - TransactionID
 *    - Customer Information
 * 4. Prepares data for Xero integration
 */

/**
 * @section Xero Integration Flow
 * @description
 * 1. System creates Xero invoice with:
 *    - Customer details (email/phone as identifier)
 *    - Payment amount
 *    - Service description
 *    - Reference number
 * 2. System immediately creates payment record in Xero:
 *    - Links to created invoice
 *    - Records payment method
 *    - Applies full payment amount
 * 3. Transaction is fully reconciled in Xero
 * 
 * @example
 * // Example webhook data transformation to Xero format
 * const paymentData = {
 *     customerName: EmailAddress || Phone,
 *     description: ServiceDescription,
 *     amount: parseFloat(PaymentAmt),
 *     reference: OrderNumber,
 *     paymentDate: PaymentDate,
 *     paymentMethod: `${CardType} ending in ${LastFour}`
 * };
 */

/**
 * @section Error Handling
 * @description
 * The system includes several error handling mechanisms:
 * 
 * 1. Payment Validation
 *    - Verifies payment status before processing
 *    - Logs failed payments without creating Xero records
 * 
 * 2. Xero Authentication
 *    - Validates token before each Xero API call
 *    - Auto-refreshes expired tokens
 *    - Redirects to auth flow if needed
 * 
 * 3. Data Validation
 *    - Validates required fields for invoice creation
 *    - Ensures proper data formatting for both systems
 *    - Handles missing or invalid data gracefully
 */

/**
 * @section Security Considerations
 * @description
 * 1. Authentication
 *    - Secure storage of Xero OAuth tokens
 *    - API key validation for Everyware
 * 
 * 2. Data Protection
 *    - Sensitive data handling (card details, personal information)
 *    - Secure webhook processing
 * 
 * 3. Error Logging
 *    - Structured error logging for debugging
 *    - No sensitive data in logs
 */

/**
 * @section Configuration Requirements
 * @description
 * Required environment variables:
 * 
 * Everyware Configuration:
 * - EVERYWARE_API_KEY
 * - EVERYWARE_USERNAME
 * - EVERYWARE_BASE_URL
