# Payment Integration Flow

## Overview
Integration between Everyware's payment processing and Xero's accounting system.

## Current Components
1. Services ✓
   - Everyware Service
     - Invoice Service ✓
     - Webhook Service
     - Payment Service
   - Xero Service
     - OAuth Authentication ✓
     - Invoice Creation
     - Payment Recording
   - Webhook Handler

2. Configuration ✓
   - Environment Variables
   - Centralized Config Management
   - SDK Initialization

3. Authentication ✓
   - Xero OAuth Flow
   - Token Management
   - Protected Routes
   - Callback Handling

## Flow Steps
1. Payment Initiation
   - [x] Create invoice in Everyware
   - [ ] Send payment link to customer
   - [ ] Customer makes payment

2. Webhook Processing
   - [x] Receive webhook from Everyware
   - [x] Verify webhook authenticity
   - [ ] Parse payment data

3. Xero Integration
   - [x] OAuth Authentication
   - [x] Create invoice in Xero
   - [x] Mark invoice as paid
   - [ ] Sync payment details

4. Error Handling
   - [ ] Payment failures
   - [ ] Webhook validation
   - [ ] Xero sync issues
   - [ ] Authentication errors

## Next Steps
1. ✓ ~~Implement Xero OAuth flow~~
2. ✓ ~~Implement Everyware invoice creation~~
3. Add webhook signature validation
4. Implement payment notification handling
5. Add proper error handling
6. Add logging system
7. Add database for token storage
8. Test payment flow end-to-end
9. Add monitoring

## Testing Checklist
- [x] Everyware API connectivity
- [x] Xero API connectivity
- [x] OAuth flow
- [ ] Webhook endpoint
- [ ] Payment flow
- [ ] Error scenarios

## Security Considerations
1. Token Storage
   - [ ] Move from memory to secure database
   - [ ] Implement encryption
   - [ ] Add token refresh mechanism

2. Webhook Security
   - [ ] Implement signature validation
   - [ ] Add request validation
   - [ ] Rate limiting

3. Error Handling
   - [ ] Implement proper error logging
   - [ ] Add error notifications
   - [ ] Create error recovery procedures

## Monitoring
- [ ] Add request logging
- [ ] Implement performance monitoring
- [ ] Set up error alerting
- [ ] Add health checks
