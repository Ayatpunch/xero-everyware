/**
 * @section Authentication Process
 * @description 
 * Before using the application, users must authenticate with Xero:
 * 
 * 1. Initial Setup:
 *    - Configure Xero app credentials in .env
 *    - Set up redirect URI in Xero developer portal
 * 
 * 2. Authentication Flow:
 *    ```mermaid
 *    sequenceDiagram
 *        participant U as User
 *        participant A as Our App
 *        participant X as Xero
 *        
 *        U->>A: Visit /auth/xero
 *        A->>X: Request authorization
 *        X->>U: Show consent screen
 *        U->>X: Grant permissions
 *        X->>A: Send auth code
 *        A->>X: Exchange code for tokens
 *        A->>A: Store tokens securely
 *        A->>U: Redirect to success page
 *    ```
 * 
 * 3. Token Management:
 *    - Access token valid for 30 minutes
 *    - Refresh token valid for 60 days
 *    - System automatically refreshes tokens

/**
 * @section Invoice Creation
 * @description
 * Creating and processing invoices involves both Everyware and Xero:
 * 
 * 1. Create Invoice Request:
 *    ```mermaid
 *    sequenceDiagram
 *        participant C as Client
 *        participant A as Our App
 *        participant E as Everyware
 *        
 *        C->>A: POST /invoices/create
 *        Note over C,A: Send invoice details
 *        A->>A: Validate request
 *        A->>E: Create payment request
 *        E->>A: Return payment URL
 *        A->>C: Return payment details
 *    ```
 * 
 * 2. Required Fields:
 *    - Customer Information
 *      - Business Name
 *      - Phone Number
 *      - Email (optional)
 *    - Invoice Details
 *      - Line Items
 *      - Amount
 *      - Due Date
 */

/**
 * @section Payment Processing
 * @description
 * When payment is received, the system automatically creates and reconciles in Xero:
 * 
 * 1. Payment Flow:
 *    ```mermaid
 *    sequenceDiagram
 *        participant E as Everyware
 *        participant A as Our App
 *        participant X as Xero
 *        
 *        E->>A: Payment webhook
 *        A->>A: Validate payment
 *        A->>X: Create invoice
 *        X-->>A: Invoice created
 *        A->>X: Apply payment
 *        X-->>A: Payment applied
 *        A->>E: Confirm receipt
 *    ```
 * 
 * 2. Webhook Processing:
 *    - Validates payment status
 *    - Creates invoice in Xero
 *    - Applies payment to invoice
 *    - Handles refunds if needed
 * 
 * 3. Error Handling:
 *    - Failed payments
 *    - Duplicate webhooks
 *    - Network issues
 *    - Token expiration
